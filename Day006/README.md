# Day 06: Reeborg's Maze Solver

## Project Description

This project is a Python script designed to help Reeborg, a robot, navigate through a maze and find the exit. The script uses functions, code blocks, and while loops to make decisions based on the environment. Reeborg can turn right, move forward, and turn left to find the path to the goal.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the `Day006` folder.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python project.py
   ```

## What I Learnt

- Creating and using functions in Python
- Implementing code blocks to organize logic
- Using while loops for repeated actions
- Basic decision-making using if-elif-else statements

## Example Output

# Note: The actual output will depend on the maze configuration and Reeborg's initial position.
