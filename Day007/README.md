# Day 07: Hangman Game

## Project Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game. The game selects a random word from a predefined list and allows the player to guess letters to uncover the word. The player has a limited number of lives, and the game ends either when the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the `Day007` folder.
2. Ensure you have the `hangman_words.py` and `hangman_art.py` files in the same directory.
3. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python project.py
   ```

## What I Learnt

- Using functions to organize code and improve readability
- Working with lists and strings in Python
- Implementing loops and conditional statements to control game logic
- Basic input and output operations
- Using modules to separate and manage different parts of the code
