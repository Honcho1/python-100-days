# 100 Days of Python Projects

## About This Repository

This repository documents my journey through a 100-day Python programming challenge. Each day, I build a new project to reinforce what I've learned, starting from basic concepts and progressively moving to more complex applications.

## Learning Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Python programming
- Practice consistent coding habits
- Learn through hands-on project development
- Master version control with Git/GitHub
- Develop problem-solving skills

## Project Structure

Each day's project will be stored in its own folder, named `Day-XXX`, where `XXX` is the day number. Inside each folder, you will find:

- `project.py`: The Python script for the day's project.
- `README.md`: A brief description of the project, what I learnt, and any challenges I faced.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference for your own learning journey. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

## Contributing
