# Day 08: Caesar Cipher Program

## Project Description

This project is a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique. The program allows users to encode or decode messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number of positions. The script uses functions with inputs to handle the encoding and decoding processes, making it a great exercise in understanding functions and string manipulation.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the `Day008` folder.
2. Ensure you have the `art.py` file in the same directory for the logo.
3. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python project.py
   ```

## What I Learnt

- Creating functions with inputs to perform specific tasks
- Manipulating strings and lists in Python
- Using the modulo operator to wrap around the alphabet
- Basic input and output operations
- Implementing a simple user interface for interaction
