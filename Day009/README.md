# Day 009 - Secret Auction Program

## Project Description  
This project is a Python implementation of a Secret Auction program. It allows multiple users to place secret bids in a command-line environment. The program stores each bidder's name and bid amount, then determines and announces the highest bidder once all bids have been placed. It's a great exercise in using dictionaries, loops, functions, and handling user input in Python.

## How to Run  
1. Navigate to the `Day009` folder.  
2. Ensure you have the `art.py` file in the same directory for the ASCII logo.  
3. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python project.py
```


## What I Learnt  
- Creating and using functions to organize code  
- Storing data in dictionaries and retrieving key-value pairs  
- Working with loops and conditional logic for program flow  
- Clearing the console to simulate a "secret" bidding process  
- Building a simple interactive program via command-line input
