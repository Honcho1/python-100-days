# Day 005: Password Generator

## Project Description

This is a simple password generator that creates a random password based on user input. The user specifies the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password. The script then generates a random password combining these elements and shuffles them to ensure randomness.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the `Day005` folder.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python project.py
   ```

## What I Learnt

- Using loops (for loops) to repeat actions
- Utilizing the range function to iterate a specific number of times
- Working with lists and appending elements
- Shuffling elements in a list using the random.shuffle method
- Basic input and output operations in Python
